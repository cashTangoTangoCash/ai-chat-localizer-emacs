<p>You’ve spotted the exact reason why Emacs is acting &quot;half-helpful.&quot; You are hitting the <strong>&quot;Trailing Character Trap.&quot;</strong></p>
<h3>🔍 Why it works on line 2 but not line 1</h3>
<p><code>C-x C-e</code> (<code>eval-last-sexp</code>) is very literal. It looks at the character <strong>immediately to the left of your cursor (point)</strong> and tries to find a complete expression ending there.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Line 2 (The &quot;Naked&quot; Lisp):</strong> Your point is right after the <code>)</code>. Emacs sees the <code>)</code> and successfully grabs everything back to the <code>(</code>. It executes <code>find-file</code> and jumps to the file.</li>
<li><strong>Line 1 (The Markdown Line):</strong> You likely have your point at the very end of the line, after the backtick (```) or the asterisk (<code>*</code>).</li>
<li>In Lisp, the backtick ``` is a special character (the <strong>backquote</strong>).</li>
<li>If your point is after the asterisk, Emacs tries to evaluate the asterisk or the backtick as part of the code.</li>
<li>When you see the code just &quot;appearing in the modeline,&quot; it means Emacs evaluated the expression but didn't trigger the &quot;jump&quot; because it might have treated the whole thing as a <strong>quoted string</strong> or a <strong>symbol</strong> rather than a <strong>function call</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>🛠️ How to fix it for your workflow</h3>
<p>You have three ways to make this &quot;Common Sense&quot; compatible for both Ghostwriter (HTML) and Emacs.</p>
<h4>1. The &quot;Precision Point&quot; Fix (No code changes)</h4>
<p>When you want to edit a capture from your transcript, don't go to the end of the line. Place your cursor **immediately after the closing parenthesis <code>)**</code>, then hit <code>C-x C-e</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>It doesn't matter that there is a ``` or a <code>*</code> to the right of the cursor; `eval-last-sexp` only looks <strong>backward</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Use a &quot;Clean&quot; Footer in the Python Script</h4>
<p>If you want to be able to just hit the end of the line and eval, we should move the Markdown formatting <em>inside</em> the Lisp or remove the trailing noise. Change your Python script assembly line to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># Instead of wrapping the whole thing in backticks, 
# just put the Lisp on its own line after the separator.
f_out.write(&quot;\n\n---\n&quot;)
f_out.write(f&quot;Edit: (find-file \&quot;./captures/{file_path.name}\&quot;)\n\n&quot;)

</code></pre>
<p>By keeping it &quot;naked&quot; (no backticks or italics), you can hit <code>End</code> then <code>C-x C-e</code> every time without fail. It will still look fine in HTML, just in a standard font.</p>
<h4>3. The &quot;Emacs Power-User&quot; Button (Recommended)</h4>
<p>If you want it to look pretty in HTML (with backticks) but work perfectly in Emacs, add this tiny &quot;Common Sense&quot; function to your <code>init.el</code>. This command searches the current line for a Lisp expression and runs it, so you don't have to be precise with your cursor:</p>
<pre><code class="language-elisp">(defun my/eval-lisp-on-line ()
  &quot;Find the first '(' on the current line and evaluate the sexp following it.&quot;
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (if (search-forward &quot;(&quot; (line-end-position) t)
        (progn
          (backward-char)
          (forward-sexp)
          (eval-last-sexp nil))
      (message &quot;No Lisp expression found on this line.&quot;))))

;; Bind it to something fast like C-c e
(global-set-key (kbd &quot;C-c e&quot;) 'my/eval-lisp-on-line)

</code></pre>

<h3>💡 Which one should you choose?</h3>
<p>If you want the &quot;lazy&quot; path (the best kind of common sense), <strong>Option 3</strong> is the winner. You can be anywhere on that line—at the start, middle, or end—and just hit <code>C-c e</code>. Emacs will &quot;break the ice,&quot; find your <code>(find-file ...)</code> inside the Markdown mess, and open the file.</p>
<p><strong>Shall I update the Python script to use the &quot;Naked&quot; format (Option 2) for now so it works without you needing to edit your <code>init.el</code>?</strong></p>
