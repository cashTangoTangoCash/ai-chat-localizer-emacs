<p>The &quot;Naked Lisp&quot; approach is definitely the winner for the <code>.md</code> file—it’s clean, it’s robust, and it respects the way <code>eval-last-sexp</code> works without requiring you to be a pixel-perfect sniper with your cursor.</p>
<p>Regarding <code>eww</code>, you've hit a fundamental wall of Emacs architecture: <strong>Major Mode separation.</strong></p>
<h3>🛑 Why <code>eww</code> won't &quot;eval&quot;</h3>
<p>When you are in <code>eww-mode</code>, Emacs isn't looking at a text file; it’s looking at a rendered DOM (Document Object Model).</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Keybindings:</strong> In <code>eww</code>, many keys are remapped (e.g., <code>q</code> to quit, <code>l</code> for back). <code>C-x C-e</code> is usually still bound to <code>eval-last-sexp</code>, but it tries to evaluate the <em>rendered text</em> in the context of the <code>eww</code> buffer.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;String&quot; Problem:</strong> Even if you hit it correctly, <code>eww</code> often handles text as read-only properties. It’s like trying to run a car engine while looking at a photograph of a car.</li>
</ol>

<h3>💡 The &quot;Common Sense&quot; Solution for <code>eww</code></h3>
<p>If you are browsing your transcript in <code>eww</code> and want to jump to the source, the most &quot;web-native&quot; way is to use a <strong>standard Markdown link</strong>.</p>
<p>Since <code>eww</code> is running <em>inside</em> Emacs, it has a superpower: if you click a link to a local file, <code>eww</code> will navigate to it. If you want to <strong>edit</strong> that file instead of just &quot;browsing&quot; it in <code>eww</code>, we can use the <code>find-file-at-point</code> (ffap) trick.</p>
<h4>Update your Python script for &quot;Dual-Mode&quot; Jumping:</h4>
<p>Let's make the assembly script provide a <strong>Lisp command</strong> for when you are in the <code>.md</code> file and a <strong>Clickable Link</strong> for when you are in <code>eww</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># In your assemble_transcript.py loop:
for file_path in files:
    with open(file_path, &quot;r&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;) as f_in:
        content = f_in.read().strip()
        f_out.write(content)
        
        # The Footer: Two ways to jump
        f_out.write(&quot;\n\n---\n&quot;)
        # 1. For MD editing:
        f_out.write(f&quot;Lisp Edit: (find-file \&quot;./captures/{file_path.name}\&quot;)  \n&quot;)
        # 2. For EWW/HTML browsing:
        f_out.write(f&quot;HTML Jump: [./captures/{file_path.name}](./captures/{file_path.name})\n\n&quot;)

<h3>⌨️ The Emacs Shortcut: <code>M-x ffap</code></h3>
<p>Instead of <code>C-x C-e</code>, try this in <code>eww</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Move your cursor anywhere over the path <code>./captures/2026...md</code>.</li>
<li>Hit <code>M-x ffap</code> (or bind it to <code>C-c f</code>).</li>
<li>Emacs will see the file path under the cursor and ask: <em>&quot;Find file: ./captures/2026...md?&quot;</em> 4.  Hit <code>Enter</code>, and it will open the actual file in its proper mode (Ghostwriter/Markdown-mode), not in <code>eww</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>🧠 Why this is &quot;Breaking the Ice&quot;</h3>
<p>You are successfully building a <strong>Hypertext System</strong>. Most people think of HTML as something for the web, but you are using it as a localized navigation layer for your own thoughts.</p>
<p>By having both the Lisp and the Link, you’ve made your transcript &quot;environmentally aware&quot;—it works whether you are viewing it as a raw document or a rendered web page.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like me to show you how to add a &quot;Return to Transcript&quot; link at the bottom of every capture file automatically, so you can bounce back and forth like a real wiki?</strong></p>
