let's make a change to watch_clipboard.sh and assemble_transcript.py.  The user is calling these scripts at a bash prompt.  Let's presume that the user has cd-ed into their desired working directory.  for watch_clipboard.sh, the captures are to go in:

/path-to-working-directory/chat/captures/

if ./chat/captures/ are not already existing folders, create them.

similarly for the python script, we are assuming the user has cd-ed into their chosen working directory (for the project which includes the chat transcript).  The resulting markdown chat transcript is to end up in:

/path-to-working-directory/chat/

where again if ./chat/ is not an existing folder, it is to be created.
