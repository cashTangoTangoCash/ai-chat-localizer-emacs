You’ve spotted the exact reason why Emacs is acting "half-helpful." You are hitting the **"Trailing Character Trap."**

### 🔍 Why it works on line 2 but not line 1

`C-x C-e` (`eval-last-sexp`) is very literal. It looks at the character **immediately to the left of your cursor (point)** and tries to find a complete expression ending there.

* **Line 2 (The "Naked" Lisp):** Your point is right after the `)`. Emacs sees the `)` and successfully grabs everything back to the `(`. It executes `find-file` and jumps to the file.
* **Line 1 (The Markdown Line):** You likely have your point at the very end of the line, after the backtick (```) or the asterisk (`*`).
* In Lisp, the backtick ``` is a special character (the **backquote**).
* If your point is after the asterisk, Emacs tries to evaluate the asterisk or the backtick as part of the code.
* When you see the code just "appearing in the modeline," it means Emacs evaluated the expression but didn't trigger the "jump" because it might have treated the whole thing as a **quoted string** or a **symbol** rather than a **function call**.

### 🛠️ How to fix it for your workflow

You have three ways to make this "Common Sense" compatible for both Ghostwriter (HTML) and Emacs.

#### 1. The "Precision Point" Fix (No code changes)

When you want to edit a capture from your transcript, don't go to the end of the line. Place your cursor **immediately after the closing parenthesis `)**`, then hit `C-x C-e`.

* It doesn't matter that there is a ``` or a `*` to the right of the cursor; `eval-last-sexp` only looks **backward**.

#### 2. Use a "Clean" Footer in the Python Script

If you want to be able to just hit the end of the line and eval, we should move the Markdown formatting *inside* the Lisp or remove the trailing noise. Change your Python script assembly line to this:

```python
# Instead of wrapping the whole thing in backticks, 
# just put the Lisp on its own line after the separator.
f_out.write("\n\n---\n")
f_out.write(f"Edit: (find-file \"./captures/{file_path.name}\")\n\n")

```

By keeping it "naked" (no backticks or italics), you can hit `End` then `C-x C-e` every time without fail. It will still look fine in HTML, just in a standard font.

#### 3. The "Emacs Power-User" Button (Recommended)

If you want it to look pretty in HTML (with backticks) but work perfectly in Emacs, add this tiny "Common Sense" function to your `init.el`. This command searches the current line for a Lisp expression and runs it, so you don't have to be precise with your cursor:

```elisp
(defun my/eval-lisp-on-line ()
  "Find the first '(' on the current line and evaluate the sexp following it."
  (interactive)
  (save-excursion
    (beginning-of-line)
    (if (search-forward "(" (line-end-position) t)
        (progn
          (backward-char)
          (forward-sexp)
          (eval-last-sexp nil))
      (message "No Lisp expression found on this line."))))

;; Bind it to something fast like C-c e
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") 'my/eval-lisp-on-line)

```

### 💡 Which one should you choose?

If you want the "lazy" path (the best kind of common sense), **Option 3** is the winner. You can be anywhere on that line—at the start, middle, or end—and just hit `C-c e`. Emacs will "break the ice," find your `(find-file ...)` inside the Markdown mess, and open the file.

**Shall I update the Python script to use the "Naked" format (Option 2) for now so it works without you needing to edit your `init.el`?**
