<p>ok, I notice that in eww I can find-file on a url to a capture file and emacs opens that capture file.  Now I have another feature in mind to play with.  I would like each capture file in the captures folder to have a corresponding html file in the captures folder.  each html file will have links to the previous and the next capture html file.  Then in eww I can go from Prompt 1 to Response 1 to Prompt 2 pretty fast with tab key and I think enter key or whatever key follows a link.  I think the python script is the one to do this.  When I run the python script, it assembles the captures (md) into one transcript (md).  Then (new) it will add prev / next links to each capture file (md) if they don't already exist.  next/prev is defined by capture file name-order.  I think it makes sense to simply convert all captures to html regardless of if any pre-exist because we might have made changes to capture .md files, and cmark runs quickly.  wait, i am confusing myself.  I think better to make a second set of capture .md file which contain links to prev/next capture html files.  So we have the original set of capture .md files which are generated by capture shell script.  Python assembly script makes 2nd set of capture .md files which have added prev/next links to capture .html files.  Python assembly script uses cmark to make capture .html files from 2nd set of capture .md files.  Python assembly script makes single .md transcript of all captures from the 1st set of capture .md files: we do not want all these next/prev links in the single transcript file.  finally python assembly script uses cmark to convert single .md transcript to .html.  Can you tell I drank caffeinated beverage?</p>
