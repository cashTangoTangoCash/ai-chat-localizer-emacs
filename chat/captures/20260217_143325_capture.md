let's try to get the emacs find-file working.  I am in Transcript_Assembly.md.  C-x C-e works in the 2nd line but not in the first.  I am assuming it must have to do with the extra characters in the first line?  I think I am putting point in the right spot to do C-x C-e but (find-file blah-blah) just appears in the modeline instead of visiting the file

*Edit this prompt/response in emacs: `(find-file "./captures/20260217_141518.md")`*
(find-file "./captures/20260217_141518.md")
