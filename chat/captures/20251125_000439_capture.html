<p>You are correct! When you run the script directly from the terminal, <code>notify-send</code> might not display the notification if you are still logged into the same session <em>unless</em> the <code>$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS</code> environment variable is correctly set and forwarded. However, it should certainly work when called via a desktop environment's keyboard shortcut binding.</p>
<p>Based on the second script I provided, the success message is already there, but let's make sure the logic is specifically hitting that successful notification block and confirm the command for maximum visibility.</p>
<p>Here is the key section of the script that handles the success notification, ensuring the file is non-empty before reporting success:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># ... (lines before the CLIP_CONTENT check) ...

if [ -z &quot;$CLIP_CONTENT&quot; ]; then
    # Warning: Clipboard content was empty
    notify-send -u normal &quot;$APP_NAME Warning&quot; &quot;Clipboard was **empty**. No file created.&quot;
else
    # Success: Save the content to the new file
    echo &quot;$CLIP_CONTENT&quot; &gt; &quot;$FILE_PATH&quot;
    
    # Notify the user of success
    # Use -t 5000 to keep the notification on screen for 5 seconds
    notify-send -t 5000 -u low &quot;$APP_NAME Success 🎉&quot; &quot;Saved non-empty content to:\n**$FILENAME**&quot;
    
    # You can also use a different icon/category for a more distinct visual success:
    # notify-send -t 5000 -u low -i document-save &quot;$APP_NAME Success&quot; &quot;Saved non-empty content to:\n$FILENAME&quot;
fi
</code></pre>
<h3>Testing Tip for Terminal Execution</h3>
<p>If you are running the script from a normal terminal session and <em>not</em> seeing the notification, try running it with the <code>-t</code> option on your shell to see any errors <code>notify-send</code> itself might be reporting.</p>
<p>Also, ensure you are running the script with the full path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">/path/to/save_clipboard_notify.sh
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If the file is non-empty and written successfully, you should see a notification bubble pop up with the following text:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Clipboard Saver Success 🎉</p>
<p><strong>Body:</strong> Saved non-empty content to:
<strong>20251124_222453.txt</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you confirm that you are running the <strong>second version</strong> of the script and that the <code>notify-send</code> command inside the <code>else</code> block is being executed?</p>
