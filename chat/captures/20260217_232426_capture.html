<p>Your intuition is spot on: <strong>Texinfo</strong> (the source format for Info mode) is a relic of a different era. It was designed to produce both printed manuals and navigable digital files from a single source, and its syntax feels like a collision between LaTeX and 1980s macro-assembler.</p>
<p>However, it’s not <em>quite</em> as arduous as it used to be, provided you don't try to write it by hand. Here is the assessment of the &quot;Hardcore Factor.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<h3>1. The &quot;Arduous&quot; Reality: Writing Texinfo by Hand</h3>
<p>If you tried to manually format your captures into <code>.texi</code> files, it would be a nightmare.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Node Pointers:</strong> Every &quot;node&quot; (page) in an Info file traditionally needs to know its &quot;Next,&quot; &quot;Previous,&quot; and &quot;Up&quot; nodes manually. If you insert a new capture in the middle, you have to manually re-index the pointers for the surrounding files.</li>
<li><strong>The &quot;Dir&quot; File:</strong> To get your captures to show up in the main Emacs Info menu (<code>C-h i</code>), you have to register them in a special system-wide or user-local <code>dir</code> file.</li>
<li><strong>Rigid Hierarchy:</strong> Info mode is obsessed with a tree structure (Top &gt; Chapter &gt; Section). It doesn't handle &quot;loose collections&quot; of files as gracefully as HTML does.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. The &quot;Modern Shortcut&quot;: Pandoc as the Bridge</h3>
<p>The reason this isn't a &quot;10/10 difficulty&quot; project is that <strong>Pandoc</strong> (the tool you just ditched for HTML) is actually the world's best Texinfo generator.</p>
<p>Instead of writing Texinfo, you would:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep writing your captures in Markdown.</li>
<li>Have a script tell Pandoc: &quot;Convert this Markdown to Texinfo.&quot;</li>
<li>Run the <code>makeinfo</code> command to turn that Texinfo into a <code>.info</code> file.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The catch?</strong> Pandoc’s Texinfo output is often &quot;fine,&quot; but getting it to look exactly right in Emacs—with proper menus and cross-references—usually requires significant manual tweaking of the intermediate file.</p>

<h3>3. Info Mode vs. Your Current EWW/HTML Setup</h3>
<p>| Feature | Info Mode Version | Your EWW/HTML Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <strong>Navigation</strong> | Superior (dedicated keys for <code>n</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>u</code>) | Good (Tab + Enter) |
| <strong>Search</strong> | Integrated (<code>s</code> or <code>i</code> for index) | Standard buffer search (<code>C-s</code>) |
| <strong>Visuals</strong> | Strictly text (no bold/italics unless configured) | Rich (CSS, Ghostwriter styles) |
| <strong>Maintenance</strong> | <strong>High</strong> (Needs re-indexing/compiling) | <strong>Zero</strong> (Instant rendering) |</p>
<hr />
<h3>🛠️ The &quot;Common Sense&quot; Verdict</h3>
<p>Creating an Info version is <strong>medium-hard</strong> if you use tools, and <strong>soul-crushing</strong> if you do it manually.</p>
<p>Unless you have a deep, aesthetic desire to see your chats look like the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, <strong>it is probably not worth the effort.</strong> Info mode shines for stable, deeply hierarchical technical documentation. For a fast-moving, &quot;caffeinated&quot; stream of chat captures, the HTML-in-EWW approach is actually the more &quot;modern-Emacs&quot; way to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>EWW is essentially the &quot;Info Mode of the 21st Century&quot;</strong>—it gives you the buffer-based navigation you love without the 1980s formatting baggage.</p>
<p><strong>Would you like me to show you how to map the <code>n</code> and <code>p</code> keys in EWW so they automatically click your &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Previous&quot; HTML links, giving you that Info-mode feel without the Texinfo pain?</strong></p>
