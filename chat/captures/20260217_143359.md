The "Naked Lisp" approach is definitely the winner for the `.md` file—it’s clean, it’s robust, and it respects the way `eval-last-sexp` works without requiring you to be a pixel-perfect sniper with your cursor.

Regarding `eww`, you've hit a fundamental wall of Emacs architecture: **Major Mode separation.**

### 🛑 Why `eww` won't "eval"

When you are in `eww-mode`, Emacs isn't looking at a text file; it’s looking at a rendered DOM (Document Object Model).

1. **Keybindings:** In `eww`, many keys are remapped (e.g., `q` to quit, `l` for back). `C-x C-e` is usually still bound to `eval-last-sexp`, but it tries to evaluate the *rendered text* in the context of the `eww` buffer.
2. **The "String" Problem:** Even if you hit it correctly, `eww` often handles text as read-only properties. It’s like trying to run a car engine while looking at a photograph of a car.

### 💡 The "Common Sense" Solution for `eww`

If you are browsing your transcript in `eww` and want to jump to the source, the most "web-native" way is to use a **standard Markdown link**.

Since `eww` is running *inside* Emacs, it has a superpower: if you click a link to a local file, `eww` will navigate to it. If you want to **edit** that file instead of just "browsing" it in `eww`, we can use the `find-file-at-point` (ffap) trick.

#### Update your Python script for "Dual-Mode" Jumping:

Let's make the assembly script provide a **Lisp command** for when you are in the `.md` file and a **Clickable Link** for when you are in `eww`.

```python
# In your assemble_transcript.py loop:
for file_path in files:
    with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f_in:
        content = f_in.read().strip()
        f_out.write(content)
        
        # The Footer: Two ways to jump
        f_out.write("\n\n---\n")
        # 1. For MD editing:
        f_out.write(f"Lisp Edit: (find-file \"./captures/{file_path.name}\")  \n")
        # 2. For EWW/HTML browsing:
        f_out.write(f"HTML Jump: [./captures/{file_path.name}](./captures/{file_path.name})\n\n")

```

### ⌨️ The Emacs Shortcut: `M-x ffap`

Instead of `C-x C-e`, try this in `eww`:

1. Move your cursor anywhere over the path `./captures/2026...md`.
2. Hit `M-x ffap` (or bind it to `C-c f`).
3. Emacs will see the file path under the cursor and ask: *"Find file: ./captures/2026...md?"* 4.  Hit `Enter`, and it will open the actual file in its proper mode (Ghostwriter/Markdown-mode), not in `eww`.

### 🧠 Why this is "Breaking the Ice"

You are successfully building a **Hypertext System**. Most people think of HTML as something for the web, but you are using it as a localized navigation layer for your own thoughts.

By having both the Lisp and the Link, you’ve made your transcript "environmentally aware"—it works whether you are viewing it as a raw document or a rendered web page.

**Would you like me to show you how to add a "Return to Transcript" link at the bottom of every capture file automatically, so you can bounce back and forth like a real wiki?**
