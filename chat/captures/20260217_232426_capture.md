Your intuition is spot on: **Texinfo** (the source format for Info mode) is a relic of a different era. It was designed to produce both printed manuals and navigable digital files from a single source, and its syntax feels like a collision between LaTeX and 1980s macro-assembler.

However, it’s not *quite* as arduous as it used to be, provided you don't try to write it by hand. Here is the assessment of the "Hardcore Factor."

---

### 1. The "Arduous" Reality: Writing Texinfo by Hand

If you tried to manually format your captures into `.texi` files, it would be a nightmare.

* **Node Pointers:** Every "node" (page) in an Info file traditionally needs to know its "Next," "Previous," and "Up" nodes manually. If you insert a new capture in the middle, you have to manually re-index the pointers for the surrounding files.
* **The "Dir" File:** To get your captures to show up in the main Emacs Info menu (`C-h i`), you have to register them in a special system-wide or user-local `dir` file.
* **Rigid Hierarchy:** Info mode is obsessed with a tree structure (Top > Chapter > Section). It doesn't handle "loose collections" of files as gracefully as HTML does.

### 2. The "Modern Shortcut": Pandoc as the Bridge

The reason this isn't a "10/10 difficulty" project is that **Pandoc** (the tool you just ditched for HTML) is actually the world's best Texinfo generator.

Instead of writing Texinfo, you would:

1. Keep writing your captures in Markdown.
2. Have a script tell Pandoc: "Convert this Markdown to Texinfo."
3. Run the `makeinfo` command to turn that Texinfo into a `.info` file.

**The catch?** Pandoc’s Texinfo output is often "fine," but getting it to look exactly right in Emacs—with proper menus and cross-references—usually requires significant manual tweaking of the intermediate file.

### 3. Info Mode vs. Your Current EWW/HTML Setup

| Feature | Info Mode Version | Your EWW/HTML Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Navigation** | Superior (dedicated keys for `n`, `p`, `u`) | Good (Tab + Enter) |
| **Search** | Integrated (`s` or `i` for index) | Standard buffer search (`C-s`) |
| **Visuals** | Strictly text (no bold/italics unless configured) | Rich (CSS, Ghostwriter styles) |
| **Maintenance** | **High** (Needs re-indexing/compiling) | **Zero** (Instant rendering) |

### 🛠️ The "Common Sense" Verdict

Creating an Info version is **medium-hard** if you use tools, and **soul-crushing** if you do it manually.

Unless you have a deep, aesthetic desire to see your chats look like the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual, **it is probably not worth the effort.** Info mode shines for stable, deeply hierarchical technical documentation. For a fast-moving, "caffeinated" stream of chat captures, the HTML-in-EWW approach is actually the more "modern-Emacs" way to handle it.

**EWW is essentially the "Info Mode of the 21st Century"**—it gives you the buffer-based navigation you love without the 1980s formatting baggage.

**Would you like me to show you how to map the `n` and `p` keys in EWW so they automatically click your "Next" and "Previous" HTML links, giving you that Info-mode feel without the Texinfo pain?**
