I am thinking of a bash script for repetitive copying (ctrl-c) which is an analog to workflows for repetitive screenshot-taking.  After copying to clipboard with ctrl-c, I can do a custom keyboard shortcut that calls the bash script.  the bash script writes what is on the clipboard to a new file in a standard destination folder, with an automatic filename based on timestamp (similar to screenshot tools).  Thus, instead of an ordered series of screenshots (each separate files and in order because of filenames), I will have an ordered series of text files.  Let's create this bash script.
