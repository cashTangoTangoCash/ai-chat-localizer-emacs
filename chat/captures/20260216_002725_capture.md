I am interested in making a perhaps easier to use version of the clipboard capture script.  The script is meant to assist with making a local copy of a very long ai chat session.  The script is started in the terminal.  The user then goes to the web browser and copies prompt then response then prompt then response and on and on.  The script watches the clipboard.  Every time the contents of the clipboard change, the script interprets that as time to send clipboard contents to another auto-named text file.  To reassure the user that things are working, the script prints to the terminal what is going on.  In other words, the script is very similar to save_clipboard_preview_v2.sh, but it keeps running on its own until the user quits out of it.  This relieves the user of having to keep moving focus back to the terminal and running the script for every clipboard capture.  make sense?
