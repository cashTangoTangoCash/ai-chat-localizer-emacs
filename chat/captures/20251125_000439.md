You are correct\! When you run the script directly from the terminal, `notify-send` might not display the notification if you are still logged into the same session *unless* the `$DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` environment variable is correctly set and forwarded. However, it should certainly work when called via a desktop environment's keyboard shortcut binding.

Based on the second script I provided, the success message is already there, but let's make sure the logic is specifically hitting that successful notification block and confirm the command for maximum visibility.

Here is the key section of the script that handles the success notification, ensuring the file is non-empty before reporting success:

```bash
# ... (lines before the CLIP_CONTENT check) ...

if [ -z "$CLIP_CONTENT" ]; then
    # Warning: Clipboard content was empty
    notify-send -u normal "$APP_NAME Warning" "Clipboard was **empty**. No file created."
else
    # Success: Save the content to the new file
    echo "$CLIP_CONTENT" > "$FILE_PATH"
    
    # Notify the user of success
    # Use -t 5000 to keep the notification on screen for 5 seconds
    notify-send -t 5000 -u low "$APP_NAME Success 🎉" "Saved non-empty content to:\n**$FILENAME**"
    
    # You can also use a different icon/category for a more distinct visual success:
    # notify-send -t 5000 -u low -i document-save "$APP_NAME Success" "Saved non-empty content to:\n$FILENAME"
fi
```

### Testing Tip for Terminal Execution

If you are running the script from a normal terminal session and *not* seeing the notification, try running it with the `-t` option on your shell to see any errors `notify-send` itself might be reporting.

Also, ensure you are running the script with the full path:

```bash
/path/to/save_clipboard_notify.sh
```

**If the file is non-empty and written successfully, you should see a notification bubble pop up with the following text:**

> **Title:** Clipboard Saver Success 🎉
>
> **Body:** Saved non-empty content to:
> **20251124\_222453.txt**

Could you confirm that you are running the **second version** of the script and that the `notify-send` command inside the `else` block is being executed?
