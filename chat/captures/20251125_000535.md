Now we will make a second script in python (because maybe python is better for this?).  This second script will assemble those separate text files into one markdown file.  This is the pattern: first a line: # prompt 1.  Then paste in that first text file.  then a line: # response 1.  Then paste in that second text file.  Then a line # prompt 2.  Then paste in that 3rd text file.  Then a line # response 2.  then paste in that 4th text file.  Can you guess where I am going with these two scripts?
