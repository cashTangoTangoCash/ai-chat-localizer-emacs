That makes perfect sense for testing and debugging directly in the terminal\! If the script is run directly, an `echo` statement is the most immediate way to confirm success or failure.

Here is the simplified script, relying on standard `echo` for terminal output instead of `notify-send`.

## 🖥️ Terminal-Friendly Clipboard Script (`save_clipboard_simple.sh`)

This script still uses `xclip` to read the clipboard but communicates all status updates via `echo`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# --- Configuration ---
DEST_DIR="$HOME/Clipboard_Captures"
CLIPBOARD_SELECTION="clipboard"

# --- Script Logic ---

# 1. Check for xclip availability
if ! command -v xclip &> /dev/null; then
    echo "ERROR: xclip not found. Please install xclip to use this script."
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Create the destination directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p "$DEST_DIR"

# 3. Generate a timestamp for the filename
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
FILENAME="${TIMESTAMP}.txt"
FILE_PATH="$DEST_DIR/$FILENAME"

# 4. Read the clipboard content
# We capture the output of xclip into a variable first to check for emptiness.
# 2>/dev/null suppresses any potential xclip error messages from polluting the output.
CLIP_CONTENT=$(xclip -selection "$CLIPBOARD_SELECTION" -o 2>/dev/null)
XCLIP_STATUS=$?

if [ $XCLIP_STATUS -ne 0 ]; then
    # Error: xclip failed (e.g., selection failure)
    echo "ERROR: Failed to read content from the clipboard."
    exit 1
fi

if [ -z "$CLIP_CONTENT" ]; then
    # Warning: Clipboard content was empty
    echo "WARNING: Clipboard was empty. No file was written."
else
    # Success: Save the content to the new file
    echo "$CLIP_CONTENT" > "$FILE_PATH"
    
    # Success message for the terminal
    echo "SUCCESS: Non-empty content saved to: $FILE_PATH"
fi
```

### How to Test in the Terminal:

1.  Copy some text (`Ctrl+C`).
2.  Run the script: `./save_clipboard_simple.sh`
3.  You will see one of the following outputs:
      * `SUCCESS: Non-empty content saved to: /home/user/Clipboard_Captures/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`
      * `WARNING: Clipboard was empty. No file was written.`
      * `ERROR: xclip not found. Please install xclip to use this script.`
