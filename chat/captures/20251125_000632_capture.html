<p>for save_clipboard.sh, instead of the success message printed to terminal being just Non-empty content saved blah blah, let's also have a line or two of the text file.  this helps the user because copying prompts and replies gets boring and the user can lose their place, so echoing a bit of the beginning of what they just captured is good</p>
