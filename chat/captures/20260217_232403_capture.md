That caffeine is hitting exactly the right circuits! You've just described a **Static Site Generator (SSG)**. You are building a localized, private version of a blog or a wiki where every "post" (capture) knows its neighbors.

The "two-set" logic is very sound. You keep your **Source** (clean captures) separate from your **Distribution** (linked HTML files).

Here is how we’ll structure the "Caffeinated Python Script." It will handle the single transcript assembly first, then loop through the captures to build the "Navigation Web."

### 🚀 The "Hyper-Transcript" Assembler

This script assumes `cmark-gfm` is in your `$PATH`.

```python
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path

def run_cmark(input_text, output_path):
    """Pipes text into cmark-gfm and saves to output_path."""
    try:
        process = subprocess.Popen(
            ['cmark-gfm', '--unsafe'], 
            stdin=subprocess.PIPE, 
            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, 
            stderr=subprocess.PIPE, 
            text=True
        )
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input=input_text)
        with open(output_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(stdout)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("Error: cmark-gfm not found. Please install it with pacman.")

def assemble_everything():
    cwd = Path.cwd()
    chat_dir = cwd / "chat"
    captures_dir = chat_dir / "captures"
    
    # Ensure directories exist
    chat_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    
    # Get sorted list of raw captures
    files = sorted(captures_dir.glob("capture_*.md"))
    if not files:
        print("No captures found.")
        return

    # --- PART 1: Assemble Single Full Transcript (.md and .html) ---
    full_md_path = chat_dir / "full_transcript.md"
    full_html_path = chat_dir / "full_transcript.html"
    full_content = [f"# Full Transcript: {cwd.name}\n\n"]

    for f_path in files:
        with open(f_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f_in:
            content = f_in.read().strip()
            full_content.append(content)
            full_content.append(f"\n\nEdit source: (find-file \"{f_path}\")\n\n---\n")

    full_md_text = "\n".join(full_content)
    with open(full_md_path, "w", encoding="utf-8") as f_out:
        f_out.write(full_md_text)
    
    run_cmark(full_md_text, full_html_path)
    print(f"✅ Created full transcript: {full_html_path.name}")

    # --- PART 2: Create Linked Individual HTML Files ---
    print("🌐 Generating linked capture web...")
    for i, f_path in enumerate(files):
        with open(f_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f_in:
            raw_body = f_in.read().strip()

        # Build Navigation Links
        prev_link = f"[← Previous]({files[i-1].stem}.html)" if i > 0 else "← Start"
        next_link = f"[Next →]({files[i+1].stem}.html)" if i < len(files) - 1 else "End →"
        nav_bar = f"\n\n**{prev_link} | [Index](../full_transcript.html) | {next_link}**\n\n"

        # Combine: Nav at top and bottom for easy scrolling
        linked_md = f"# {f_path.stem}\n{nav_bar}---\n\n{raw_body}\n\n---\n{nav_bar}"
        
        # Convert directly to HTML
        output_html = captures_dir / f"{f_path.stem}.html"
        run_cmark(linked_md, output_html)

    print(f"✅ Done! {len(files)} individual pages linked.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    assemble_everything()

```

### 🧠 Why this is "High-Octane" Common Sense

1. **Direct-to-Pipe:** Notice the Python script doesn't actually save a "2nd set" of `.md` files to your disk. It generates the "Linked Markdown" in memory and pipes it straight into `cmark-gfm`. This keeps your folders clean.
2. **Relative Linking:** The links use `.html` extensions. Since you are in `eww`, when you click `[Next →]`, Emacs looks at the file on your disk and renders the next page instantly.
3. **The "Index" Link:** I added a link back to the `full_transcript.html` in the middle of the nav bar. This is your "Escape Hatch" if you get lost in the captures.

### ⌨️ How to use this in Emacs/EWW

1. Run your script.
2. In Emacs, hit `M-x eww-open-file`.
3. Select `./chat/captures/capture_2026...01.html`.
4. **The Workflow:**
* Read the response.
* Hit `Tab` (takes you to the "Next" link).
* Hit `Enter`.
* *Boom.* You are on the next page.
* If you see a typo, use your `(find-file ...)` trick at the bottom to jump to the `.md` source, fix it, and re-run the script.



### One Small Warning

Since `eww` caches pages sometimes, if you edit an `.md` file and re-run the script, you might need to hit `g` (reload) in the `eww` buffer to see the updated HTML.

**Would you like me to add a "Table of Contents" to the `full_transcript.html` that links to each of these individual pages?**
