<p>ok, how about in the script to assemble the transcript, each entry ends with some lisp:</p>
<p>e.g.
(find-file &quot;./captures/20260214_170754.md&quot;)</p>
<p>not sure how that should be formatted in markdown so it looks good in html.  the notion is that if I visit the html (or of course md) transcript in eww. I think I can evaluate the lisp to go straight to the capture file and fix something.  I would also like a way to get from the capture file to the right spot in the transcript but this new feature does allow me to search in the transcript for e.g. 170754 which works with a little effort</p>
